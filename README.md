# gerg
Implementation of GERG 2008 eos

This is a practice Repository. But do not let the word "practice" fool you. It is an advanced application of chemical engineering studies into the real word using Java. The goal is not just to have some real world experience but also a way to provide some interesting and useful tool to the community. Feel free to send your ideas and contribute to this project as well.
