# GERG 2008 Java Implementation

## Overview
This project is an educational (and only educational) implementation of the GERG 2008 Equation of State (EOS), originally developed by [O. Kunz and W. Wagner ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/je300655b). Although primarily an educational tool, it applies advanced chemical engineering concepts to real-world scenarios using Java. The goal is to improve my Java skills while providing a useful tool for the community.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
You need to have JDK 22 and Postgres database to run it without further ado. However, other databases can be used, as long as it is a relational database and the right modifications on the application.properties are done. I have provided a sql txt file in order to populate carbon dioxide and pentane parameters, other substances must be populated manually for now. Before running the sql, load the classes using JPA|Hibernate manager by running the app, otherwise a error message should be expected. 

<h2>Tools</h2>
- JDK 22
- Springboot
- Vaadin
- Postgress

<h4>What it doesnt have yet</h4>
- JWT or any other type of authentication
